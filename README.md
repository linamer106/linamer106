# Hi, I'm Lina Amer 👋
**Software Engineering Student at the University of Auckland | Passionate about Software Design, Software Testing and AI**  

> A fast-learning software engineering student passionate about software technology and its impact — from managing systems to AI and space exploration. Curious by nature, I thrive on understanding the *how* and *why* behind systems, and I’m most fulfilled when collaborating to build solutions for meaningful purposes.  

> I believe the best results come from shared ideas, teamwork, and continuous learning. Outside the classroom, I actively seek challenges through hackathons, tech communities, and personal projects.
